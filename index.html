        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>Here I will present three artifacts, three projects I have worked on in my final year at Southern New Hampshire University.
        One project is from a course final, the other two I worked on in my spare time in order to prep for an interview. An infomal code review is also included.</p>

        <h3>Professional Self Assessment</h3>
        
        <p>Firstly, thank you so much for taking the time to view and examine my ePortfolio. This project will provide a look at my work as well as how I operate
         and how I think as an engineer. Starting my journey as a Computer Science student I had little to no experience programming. What I had completed
         could not be considered professional in any aspect up until that point. </p>
        
        <p>Within this ePortfolio are three artifacts, each separate projects I have worked on during my senior year at SNHU. 
        I am using three separate projects as I feel they demonstrate very specific skills each on their own. </p>
        
        <p>My first artifact is my Computer Graphics and Visualization Final Project, where I demonstrate my skills in 3D modeling, C++ programming, as well as my ability to think as an engineer collaborating 
            in a team environment as well as with stakeholders if necessary. </p>

        <p>My second artifact is a Collaborative Editor, a very much simplified version of Google Docs. With this project my skills and
         know-how are on full display on the topic of data structures and algorithms, C# programming, and here specifically, my knowledge and skill utilizing Web Sockets. </p>4

        <p>My final artifact is a Notes application. This project was also made using C# while also utilizing MSSQL. Because of it's nature and quality, I decided this project would
         be a great addition to my ePortfolio because of its demonstration of my knowledge and skill with programming in C# as well as setting up and properly manipulating databases. </p>

        <p>Through all of these projects, and especially with their enhancements made in my final term at SNHU, I made sure to look at my own past projects empirically and with a security mindset. 
        I made sure to properly examine and test my code so that security flaws and vulnerabilities were properly tested and weeded out.</p>

        <p>Though it is not present within this ePortfolio for contractual reasons, I am currently working as a Full Stack Software Engineer on a Patient Information Management System as well as a smaller feature, an Audio-to-Text Transcribing application. 
        My time at both Sierra College and Southern New Hampshire University has prepared me to tackle this project professionally. 
        While this project is ongoing I have made sure to communicate properly with my employer as well as document my work thoroughly through
         in-code comments as well as by using project management software (Trello and Balsamiq) and creating easy to read and understand documentations 
        in the form of Software Design documents. </p>
