                    <p>Firstly, thank you so much for taking the time to view and examine my ePortfolio. This project will provide a look at my work as well as how I operate and how I think as an engineer. Starting my journey as a Computer Science student I had little to no experience programming. What I had completed could not be considered professional in any aspect up until that point.</p>
                    
                    <p>Within this ePortfolio are three artifacts, each separate projects I have worked on during my senior year at SNHU. I am using three separate projects as I feel they demonstrate very specific skills each on their own.</p>
                    
                    <p>My first artifact is my Computer Graphics and Visualization Final Project, where I demonstrate my skills in 3D modeling, C++ programming, as well as my ability to think as an engineer collaborating in a team environment as well as with stakeholders if necessary.</p>
                    
                    <p>My second artifact is a Collaborative Editor, a very much simplified version of Google Docs. With this project my skills and know-how are on full display on the topic of data structures and algorithms, C# programming, and here specifically, my knowledge and skill utilizing Web Sockets.</p>
                    
                    <p>My final artifact is a Notes application. This project was also made using C# while also utilizing MSSQL. Because of its nature and quality, I decided this project would be a great addition to my ePortfolio because of its demonstration of my knowledge and skill with programming in C# as well as setting up and properly manipulating databases.</p>
                    
                    <p>Through all of these projects, and especially with their enhancements made in my final term at SNHU, I made sure to look at my own past projects empirically and with a security mindset. I made sure to properly examine and test my code so that security flaws and vulnerabilities were properly tested and weeded out.</p>
                    
                    <p>Though it is not present within this ePortfolio for contractual reasons, I am currently working as a Full Stack Software Engineer on a Patient Information Management System as well as a smaller feature, an Audio-to-Text Transcribing application. My time at both Sierra College and Southern New Hampshire University has prepared me to tackle this project professionally. While this project is ongoing I have made sure to communicate properly with my employer as well as document my work thoroughly through in-code comments as well as by using project management software (Trello and Balsamiq) and creating easy to read and understand documentations in the form of Software Design documents.</p>

                <p>I genuinely found this course to be really stimulating and useful, but more so for my side projects. I don't plan on becoming a game developer within the gaming industry, but I do plan on and am already working on developing video games as a hobby. Utilizing OpenGL is a great way to provide detailed graphics for my hobby's needs.</p>
                
                <p>Attention to detail and dedication to providing a quality product is demonstrated by the enhancements I made to this artifact. This makes me a much more viable candidate due to my dedication to quality code and presentation. Structuring the product better also improved the quality overall. Enhancements made include proper error handling implementation in the case of objects not properly rendering, as well as an improved structure of code for better readability and understanding within a collaborative environment.</p>

                <p>This artifact demonstrates my skills in manipulating algorithms and data structures. By enhancing the way the Web Socket operated within the application I was able to improve performance by ensuring changes made were the only things changed, as before the application would reload the entire file after changes were made. This application through my enhancements in my final term at SNHU has become more scalable and memory efficient!</p>

                <p>This artifact effectively demonstrates my understanding and skill in developing and manipulating databases (here specifically using MSSQL). Enhancements include adding error handling as well as input validation and data sanitization. This was a crucial update to a solid application as prior to the enhancements made there were some pretty obvious vulnerabilities in both data integrity and input validation and sanitization. These enhancements made the application much more secure as well as resilient.</p>
